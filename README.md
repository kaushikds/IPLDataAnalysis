# IPLDataAnalysis
This notebook is about practicing the first data analysis steps of loading the data into a pandas dataframe, getting some basic information about the dataset using pandas functions, and cleaning the dataset by finding null values:
* Loading data into a dataframe by using the pandas method - .csv_load()
* Printing the first 5 rows of the dataframe by using the pandas method - .head()
* Printing the Number of Rows and the Number of Columns present in the dataframe, or "shape of the data", by using the pandas method - .shape()
* Finding out the type of data present in each column in the dataframe by printing the dataframe attribute - .dtypes
*
