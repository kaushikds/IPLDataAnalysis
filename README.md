# IPLDataAnalysis
This notebook is about practicing the data analysis steps of loading the data into a pandas dataframe and getting some basic information about the dataset using pandas functions:
* Loading data into a dataframe by using the pandas method - **.csv_load()**
* Printing the first 5 rows of the dataframe by using the pandas method - **.head()**
* Printing the Number of Rows and the Number of Columns present in the dataframe, or "shape of the data", by using the pandas method - **.shape()**
* Finding out the type of data present in each column in the dataframe by printing the dataframe's **dtypes** attribute
